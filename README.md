# Personal Code Library

## Overview

Welcome to my **Personal Code Library** â€” a curated collection of useful scripts, code snippets, and logic systems I've written or adapted while working on various projects. The main purpose of this repository is to **store**, **reuse**, and **improve** common solutions and patterns I find helpful during game development, especially in **GameMaker** and similar environments.

This is a living document, designed to **grow as I learn**.

## Purpose

- Speed up development with reusable code  
- Organize tested solutions in one place  
- Serve as a personal reference while learning new engines (like GameMaker)  
- Improve readability and maintenance of game logic

## Notes

- Most code is written in **GML (GameMaker Language)** but can be adapted to other engines with similar scripting logic.
- Comments are included for clarity and future editing.
- Contributions and tweaks from my future self are welcome.
- And for god's sake, if you see some way to improve it, reach me out. I always welcome a chance to learn.
