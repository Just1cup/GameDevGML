# Personal Code Library

## Overview

Welcome to my **Personal Code Library** — a curated collection of useful scripts, code snippets, and logic systems I've written or adapted while working on various projects. The main purpose of this repository is to **store**, **reuse**, and **improve** common solutions and patterns I find helpful during game development, especially in **GameMaker** and similar environments.

This is a living document, designed to **grow as I learn**.

## Purpose

- Speed up development with reusable code  
- Organize tested solutions in one place  
- Serve as a personal reference while learning new engines (like GameMaker)  
- Improve readability and maintenance of game logic

## Notes

-  Code is mostly in **GML (GameMaker Language)**.
-  Everything here is **modular, reusable, and commented**.
-  Experiments live next to working systems — so explore!
-  **Always open to feedback** — if you spot a better way, **reach out**. I'm always looking to learn.

-  ##  From Me to Me

This repo is a gift to my future self — so don't fuck up you future self and do your damn work.
